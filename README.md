# Option-Pricing & Hedging Simulation Framework

A compact Python/Jupyter toolkit for **pricing European options** and **stress-testing hedge strategies** under Black-Scholes dynamics.

## Highlights
- **Monte-Carlo pricer** — values calls/puts and Greeks (Δ, Γ) across strike-maturity grids.  
- **Dynamic hedge simulator** — compares Delta- and Delta-Gamma-hedged portfolios, tracking P&L, slippage and hedge error over thousands of price paths.  
- **Self-contained notebooks** — `Pricing Theory Project1.ipynb` (pricing) and `Pricing_Project_2.ipynb` (hedging) walk through code & plots step by step.
